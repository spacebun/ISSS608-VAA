<p><img src="images/clipboard-1758350966.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>In this exercise, we’ll apply <strong>visual interactivity</strong> and <strong>visualizing uncertainty</strong> methods to validate either of the <a href="https://www.nccs.gov.sg/singapores-climate-action/impact-of-climate-change-in-singapore/">claims on future climate projection</a> in the infographic above that:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Daily mean temperature are projected to increase by 1.4 to 4.6 C, and</p></li>
<li><p>The contrast between the wet months (November to January) and dry month (February and June to September) is likely to be more pronounced.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>We will choose to validate the first claim that <strong>“Daily mean temperature are projected to increase by 1.4 to 4.6 C”</strong>.</p>
<p>To do so, we will use the daily temperature records of <strong>June</strong> of the years 1983, 1993, 2003, 2013 and 2023 collected at the <strong>Changi</strong> climate station, to create an analytics-driven data visualisation.</p>
<p>We will apply appropriate interactive techniques to enhance the user experience in data discovery and/or visual story-telling.</p>

<p>Next, we load the <a href="http://www.weather.gov.sg/climate-historical-daily/">Climate Historical Daily Records</a> for the <strong>Changi</strong> weather station, for the five years 1983, 1993, 2003, 2013 and 2023. The data for each month of the five years was downloaded using a python script. The data, in the form of .CSV files, will be imported as a list of CSV files, then compiled into a single dataframe using R.</p>
<p>First, we read in all .CSV files into a list object of dataframes. As the .CSV files may be ended with either UTF-8 or ISO-8859-1 encoding, we will create a function to read in the .CSV files that encompasses both types of encoding.</p>
<p>Next, we identify columns with inconsistent data types across all the dataframes:</p>

<p>From the code chunk above, we observe that:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The ‘Mean Wind Speed (km/h)’ and ‘Max Wind Speed (km/h)’ columns exhibit data type inconsistencies.</p>
<ul>
<li>These columns will be uniformly converted to numeric type.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>The columns ‘Highest 30 Min Rainfall (mm)’, ‘Highest 60 Min Rainfall (mm)’, and ‘Highest 120 Min Rainfall (mm)’ are type character in some dataframes, and NA type in other dataframes.</p>
<ul>
<li>This suggests that these columns are present in some dataframes but absent in others. We will address the handling of these columns later on.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>We hence convert the ‘Mean Wind Speed (km/h)’ and ‘Max Wind Speed (km/h)’ columns to numeric type:</p>

<p>From the above, we observe these data quality issues and actionable insights:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The <em>glimpse</em> function shows three columns ‘Year’, ‘Month’, ‘Day’ representing the date of the record.</p>
<ul>
<li>These columns can be used to create a ‘Date’ column of date type that would make visualizing the data for different time periods easier.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>The <em>glimpse</em> function shows the presence of character values <strong><code>"\u0097"</code></strong> in the columns ‘Highest 30 Min Rainfall (mm)’, ‘Highest 60 Min Rainfall (mm)’, and ‘Highest 120 Min Rainfall (mm)’.</p>

<li><p>These non-numeric placeholders represent missing values and should be converted to NA.</p></li>
<li><p>These columns should also be of type numeric instead of character.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>The <em>glimpse</em> function also shows there is a possible naming inconsistency of the ‘Highest 30 Min Rainfall (mm)’, ‘Highest 60 Min Rainfall (mm)’, and ‘Highest 120 Min Rainfall (mm)’ character type columns, where similar columns ‘Highest 30 <strong>min</strong> Rainfall (mm)’, ‘Highest 60 <strong>min</strong> Rainfall (mm)’, and ‘Highest 120 <strong>min</strong> Rainfall (mm)’ of numeric type exist. The <em>vis_miss()</em> function confirms this naming inconsistency.</p>
<ul>
<li>This can be resolved by merging the information in the character and double type columns.</li>

<h1 data-number="4"><span class="header-section-number">4</span> Investigating Temperature Claims</h1>
<p>To address the future climate projection claim that “Daily mean temperature are projected to increase by 1.4 to 4.6C”, we will look at the following measures:</p>
<ul>
<li>‘Mean_Temperature’</li>
<li>‘Max_Temperature’</li>
<li>‘Min_Temperature’</li>
</ul>
<p>For each measure, we will:</p>
<ul>
<li>Plot ridge line and interactive violin-box plot to observe distribution,</li>
<li>Plot uncertainty (point estimate with error bar and confidence interval) to get a sensing of confidence of the mean,</li>
<li>Plot statistical test to determine if difference between the years are statistically significant.</li>
</ul>
<section id="looking-at-mean_temperature" class="level2" data-number="4.1">
<h2 data-number="4.1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="looking-at-mean_temperature"><span class="header-section-number">4.1</span> Looking at ‘Mean_Temperature’</h2>

<h3 data-number="4.1.1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="distribution-of-values"><span class="header-section-number">4.1.1</span> Distribution of values</h3>
<p>We first observe the distributions of the ‘Mean_Temperature’ values in June for the five years, with a static <strong>ridge line plot</strong>. This plot will allow us to also visually compare the values across the years.</p>
<p>While the ridge line plot gives a good view of distribution shape for the years, it lacks details such as median, and interquartiles.</p>
<p>To make the visualization of distribution more informative for a user, we choose to use <strong>plot_ly</strong> to plot an <strong>interactive violin plot and boxplot</strong>. The addition of a boxplot adds statistical detail to the distributions being plotted. The summary statistics will appear on hover as a tooltip, giving a user a handy view of some details on the data. Moreover, we will include the mean and median lines. On hover, a line is shown across the plots enabling for easy yet accurate comparison of mean and median values across the years.</p>

<li>The rightward shift of peaks over the years suggests an increase in average temperature.</li>
<li>Distribution shapes vary, with some resembling normal distributions (1983, 2003, 2023) and others showing non-normal distributions or multiple peaks (1993, 2013).</li>
<li>The distribution for years 2003, 2013, and 2023 exhibit more negative skewness compared to 1983 and 1993, supported by higher median than mean values, indicating a higher frequency of hotter days in those years.</li>
<li>The left tails of the distributions, are not extending as far left in more recent years as they do in earlier years. This suggests a decrease in the occurrence of lower temperature extremes, which could mean fewer cooling days in June in recent years.</li>
<li>The right tails have remained similar in position across the five years, indicating that the magnitude of warmer temperature extremes in June have stayed relatively consistent over the five years.</li>
<li>From the violin plot, median temperatures show a slight increase over the years, but with a dip in 2013 and similarity between 2003 and 2023.</li>
<li>The interquartile ranges do not show a consistent trend in terms of becoming wider or narrower, implying that the variability around the median does not follow a clear pattern over the years.</li>
<li>The lower tails show an increasing trend. Similar to the ridge line plot, this indicates fewer cooler days in recent years.</li>
<li>However, notably the year 2003 had the most extreme low mean temperature values.</li>

<p>To determine whether the mean daily temperatures in June have varied significantly over the span of five years, we will conduct a statistical test. We earlier observed that some of the data is non-normal, hence we will use a non-parametric test. Since we have multiple groups, it will be a Kruskal-Wallis one-way ANOVA test.</p>

<li>Null Hypothesis (H0): There is no difference in the median values among the five years. This means that any observed difference in among the years is due to random chance.</li>
<li>Alternative Hypothesis (H1): There is a difference in the median values among the five years. This means that the observed difference is not due to chance, and there is a true difference among the years.</li>

<ul>
<li>The p-value is below 0.05. Hence we have sufficient evidence to reject the Null Hypothesis. We can conclude that there is evidence to indicate that there is a difference in the median temperatures for June across the years.</li>
<li>However, closer inspection of pairwise differences reveals that no 10-year intervals (for example, comparing 1983 to 1993, comparing 2003 to 2013 etc.) has a p-value below 0.05. This indicates that there is not statistical evidence that the mean daily temperature for June is actually different for the 10-year intervals.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<p>It may not be accurate to claim that the temperature increases each year. Moreover, we have shown that the magnitude of temperature increases across the years for the month of June is not very large - nowhere close to 1.4 to 4.6 C.</p>
<p>Let’s look next at ‘Min_Temperature’.</p>

<li>The positions of the distributions look similar across the years, with no notable or consistent shift towards the left or right.</li>
<li>The left tails of the distributions are quite consistent in extending to the far left. This suggests consistent occurrence of extreme minimum temperatures across the years.</li>
<li>The shape of distributions are non-normal, except for the year 1983. Some of the non-normal distributions have multiple peaks, like 1993 and 2023.</li>
<li>Looking at the violin plot, the median temperatures do appear to rise slightly from 1983 to 1993 to 2003, but seem to dip at 2013 before a slight rise in 2023.</li>
<li>Notably the year 1983 had the most extreme low Min_Temperature values.</li>

<li>The trend in magnitude of temperature increase is not consistent. From 1983 to 1993 there was a slight increase in temperature, and a larger increase from 1993 to 2003. However, the mean seemed to dip from 2003 to 2013 and slightly rise from 2013 to 2023.</li>
<li>The error bars and confidence intervals for the years 1983 and 1993 overlap almost completely, while the error bars for the years 2003, 2013 and 2023 overlap almost completely. This overlap suggests that the difference between the years is not statistically significant.</li>

<p>Given that the data is non-normal and there are multiple groups, we will use a Kruskal-Wallis one-way ANOVA test to test whether the Min_Temperature varies significantly among the five years.</p>
<p>The hypotheses would be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Null Hypothesis (H0): There is no difference in the median values among the five years. This means that any observed difference in among the years is due to random chance.</li>
<li>Alternative Hypothesis (H1): There is a difference in the median values among the five years. This means that the observed difference is not due to chance, and there is a true difference among the years.</li>

<li>The p-value is above 0.05. Hence we do not have sufficient evidence to reject the Null Hypothesis. We cannot conclude that there is evidence to indicate that there is a difference in the median Min_Temperature values for June across the years.</li>

<li>The positions of the distributions look fluctuate slightly over the years. From 1983 to 1993, the distribution shifted left; from 1993 to 2003, the distribution shifted right. The distribution position remained quite constant from 2003 to 2013 to 2023.</li>
<li>The left tails of the distributions are quite consistent in extending to the far left.</li>
<li>The shape of distributions are non-normal, except for the year 1993 Some of the non-normal distributions have multiple peaks, like 2013 and 2023.</li>
<li>The median temperatures fluctuate across the years. From the years 2003 to 2023, the median ‘Max_Temperature’ value decreases.</li>
<li>The years also have very long lower tails, indicating days where the maximum temperature was not so high. These would have been more cooling days.</li>

<p>Given that the data is non-normal and there are multiple groups, we will use a Kruskal-Wallis one-way ANOVA test to test whether the Max_Temperature varies significantly among the five years.</p>
<p>The hypotheses would be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Null Hypothesis (H0): There is no difference in the median values among the five years. This means that any observed difference in among the years is due to random chance.</li>
<li>Alternative Hypothesis (H1): There is a difference in the median values among the five years. This means that the observed difference is not due to chance, and there is a true difference among the years.</li>

<p>To comprehensively evaluate the claim regarding future climate projections of a 1.4 to 4.6°C increase in daily mean temperatures, we will examine the daily temperature difference (the difference between ‘Max_Temperature’ and ‘Min_Temperature’). Analysing this will help validate if observed trends in mean temperatures are consistent with changes in daily temperature variability.</p>

<li>There appears to be no notable or consistent shift towards the left or right across the years.</li>
<li>The distributions for the years 1993 and 2013 appear to be flatter than the the other years, indicating greater temperature differences between minimum and maximum temperature.</li>
<li>For the years 1983, 1993 and 2013, the right tails appear to extend more to the right, suggesting more days where daily temperature difference is higher.</li>
<li>The shape of distributions are non-normal, except for the year 2003.</li>
<li>While there appears to be no notable trend in median values across the years, the year 2023 has the lowest median value suggesting that there were more days where the daily temperature difference was smaller.

<p>The hypotheses would be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Null Hypothesis (H0): There is no difference in the median values among the five years. This means that any observed difference in among the years is due to random chance.</li>
<li>Alternative Hypothesis (H1): There is a difference in the median values among the five years. This means that the observed difference is not due to chance, and there is a true difference among the years.</li>

<li>The p-value is above 0.05. Hence we do not have sufficient evidence to reject the Null Hypothesis. We cannot conclude that there is evidence to indicate that there is a difference in the median Temp_Difference values for June across the years.</li>
<li>Moreover, no pairwise comparisons between the years show any p-value below 0.05 - indicating that we cannot conclude that the difference in Temp_Difference values between any of the years is significantly different.</li>

<h2 data-number="4.5" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="summary-and-conclusion"><span class="header-section-number">4.5</span> Summary and conclusion</h2>
<p>In conclusion, we used visualizations to explore the various temperature measures (including daily mean, daily minimum, daily maximum, and daily difference) for the Changi weather station for the month of June across years of 1983, 1993, 2003, 2013 and 2023. Despite the claim projecting an increase in temperature magnitudes ranging from 1.4 to 4.6°C, our visual and statistical analyses of historical values did not support this projection.</p>
<p>Visually, our distribution plots depicted a consistent upward trajectory in temperature magnitudes for <strong>daily mean temperature</strong> across the years. However, statistical tests conducted showed that that the differences in the point estimate of daily mean temperature across these periods lacked statistical significance for 10-year intervals.</p>
<p>This was supported by the analysis of the daily minimum, daily maximum, and daily difference as well. This exercise suggests that while there could be increase in daily mean temperature over the years, more can be done to explore if the projected magnitude of increase is indeed as drastic as 1.4 to 4.6°C.</p>
